Idle Town Builder is an idle phone game where you build buildings, satisfy your citizens, and research new buildings and improvements. 
The game has five main pages Buildings, Market, Population, Science, and Kingdom.

The buildings page allows you to build and upgrade buildings. It also shows the progress of resources being generated. The resources can be tapped to speed up production.

On the market page you can sell your goods or turn on autosale for any goods that you aren't using.

The population page shows what goods your citizens are demanding and their satisfaction. Satisfaction and growth level determine the population growth rate. Happy citizens produce prestige which can be used to
buy upgrades that let you build your next city faster and unlock new buildings, resources, and populations. There is also a button to switch races. There are different races and classes
available depending on which city you are building.

The kingdom page lets you start new cities. Starting a new city gives you the earned prestige from the previous city and allows you to unlock new buildings and upgrades. You unlock new cities by completing
the tasks from previous cities.

The game is still a bit rough and needs a lot of balancing. Some features are more in development than others like the building managers and the gem store.
